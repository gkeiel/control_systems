# Control systems

A repository of algorithms for computing gains in modern control systems. Each algorithm has its own folder, containing the function code and the corresponding example.

##

The following algorithms are available:
- [MIMO state feedback](./MIMO_state_feedback)
- [output feedback](./output_feedback)
